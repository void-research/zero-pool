/// A future that tracks completion of submitted tasks
///
/// `TaskFuture` provides both blocking and non-blocking ways to wait for
/// task completion. Tasks can be checked for completion, waited on
/// indefinitely, or waited on with a timeout.
///
/// `TaskFuture` is cheaply cloneable. However, it captures the thread handle
/// of the thread that created it.
///
/// If sharing the future with other threads, `is_complete()` is safe to call
/// from anywhere.
///
/// **Important:** `wait()` and `wait_timeout()` **must** be called from the
/// same thread that created the `TaskFuture`. Calling these methods from a
/// different thread will panic in debug builds and may cause the calling thread
/// to hang indefinitely in release builds.
